        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Why Mochi?</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The web is becoming increasingly centralized, and most analytics services either invade privacy or are built for businesses, not individuals.
          I created Mochi because I wanted something <span class="font-bold">minimal</span>, <span class="font-bold">private</span>, and <span class="font-bold">indie</span>‚Äîsomething that aligns with the spirit of the open web.

          Mochi is a lightweight, open-source analytics service designed for personal blogs and small projects. It provides essential insights without tracking invasive data‚Äîno cookies, no profiling, just simple stats.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">A Note on Stability</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Mochi is an experimental service, and I can't guarantee long-term stability.
          If you need a more reliable solution with guaranteed uptime and data retention,
          consider using a more mature service like <a class="text-blue-500 underline" href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
           Mochi isn't here to compete‚Äîit exists to provide an open source, potentially self-hostable alternative for those who love the open web.
